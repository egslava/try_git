Simple lists
======
There're many situations, when you should render much amount of structured data. For instance, you might want to load from a server list of people. Let's see an example:

```java
@EActivity
public class SimpleListActivity extends ListActivity {
	@Bean
	ViewMapperAdapter	adapter;
	
	@AfterInject
	void init(){
		List<Person> people = Person.generatePeople(1000, this);
		adapter.setObjects(people);
		setListAdapter(adapter);
	}
}
```
That's all! In this example ListActivity will show thousand people. But what layout will be inflated as an list item element? The answer is "person.xml". Let's see on outline of person.xml and data inside class Person:

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td>

```
-LinearLayout
|-LinearLayout
||-$firstName (TextView)
||-$lastName (TextView)
||-$middleName (TextView)
||-$birthday (TextView)
|-LinearLayout
||-minus
||-count
||-plus
```
</td>
<td>

```java
public class Person{
	public String	avatar;
	public Date		birthday;
	public String	firstName;
	public String	lastName;
	public String	middleName;
	...
}
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

So, as you can see, the naming conventions for class and for xml are the same as for [simple mapping](net-utils-samples-simple-mapping).

You might noticed, that the layout also contains buttons "plus"/"minus" and textview "count", but they don't work. Also you might want to change layout name from person.xml to, for instance, my_person.xml. How to do this you may see in the [next tutorial](net-utils-samples-list-with-logic).
